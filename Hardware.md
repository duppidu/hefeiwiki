##  Additional Hardware

We added the following hardware to the Robotino:

 - SICK Laser Module TIM551 connected over Ethernet to Robotino
 - 2 x Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 connected over USB to Robotino
 - Thinkerforge Servobrick connected over USB to Robotino
 - 2 x standard Futaba Servos for the Gripper
  
##  Function of the Hardwareparts  
  
####  Laser Module:

Measures distances to objects in a range of 270 degrees.  
#####  Lifecams:

The upper cam is for colordetection.
The lower cam is for the ALVAR Marker detection.  
  
#####  Servobrick:  

The Servobrick controls the rc-servos of the gripper.  
  
#####  Servos:

The servos control the claw of the gripper.  

  
## 3D-Printed Parts

We use 3d-printed mounts to mount our hardware parts.

The Lasermount, IR-Sensormount were created by Ramon DÃ¤ster and will not be explained here.  
  
#####  Camera Mount:

The camera must be panable, so you can adjust it by changing it's angle.
The cameramount consists of three parts:

 - Mount for Motedisprofile
 - Basic camera enclosure
 - lid

The difference between the upper cammount and the lower cammount is just the Mount for the Motedisprofile which has different mountingholes.
 
 To put the cameramount together you need the following screws and nuts:
 
 - 2 x M3x16mm and nut
 -  1 x M3x10mm and nut
 - 2 x M5x10mm (upper cam)
 - 2 x M5 t-nut
 - 1 x M5x10mm (lower cam)  
  
#####  Gripper:

The gripper consists of 3 parts.

 - Claw left
 - Claw right
 - Servomount

To put the gripper together you need the following screws and nuts:

 - 2 x M5x16
 - 8 x M3x16 and nut
 - 2 x M5 t-nut
 - 4 x self cutting Servoscrews


The claws are mounted directly to the servowheel with the selfcutting screws (screws from bottom to top).    


  
#####  Servobrick enclosure:

For the servobrick we created just an enclosure with one mounting screw.


To put the enclosure together you need the following screws and nuts:

 - 2x M3x15mm and Nut
 - 1x M4x10mm and Nut
 

The enclosure is mounted on the plate of the Robotino.  

  
#####  Mount for Motedisprofile:

This part was created to mount a 40x20 Motedis profile on the plate of Robotino.

To mount **1** Profile you need the following parts:

1x 3d printed mount
2x M5 x 10mm 
2x M4 x 16mm and nuts
2x M5 t-nut
