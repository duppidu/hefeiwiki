##  Additional Hardware

We added the following hardware to the Robotino:

 - SICK Laser Module TIM551 connected over Ethernet to Robotino
 - 2 x Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 connected over USB to Robotino
 - Thinkerforge Servobrick connected over USB to Robotino
 - 2 x standard Futaba Servos for the Gripper
  
##  Function of the Hardwareparts  
  
####  Laser Module:

Measures distances to objects in a range of 270 degrees.  

####  Lifecams:

The upper cam is for colordetection.
The lower cam is for the ALVAR Marker detection.  
  
####  Servobrick:  

The Servobrick controls the rc-servos of the gripper.  
  
####  Servos:

The servos control the claw of the gripper.  

  
## 3D-Printed Parts

We use 3d-printed mounts to mount our hardware parts.
The parts were designed in Autodesk Inventor (files in the end of the document)

The Lasermount, IR-Sensormount were created by Ramon DÃ¤ster and will not be explained here.  
  
#### Upper Camera Mount:

The camera must be panable, so you can adjust it by changing it's angle.
The cameramount consists of three parts:

 - Mount for Motedisprofile
 - Basic camera enclosure
 - lid

 To put the cameramount together you need the following screws and nuts:
 
 - 2 x M3x20mm and nut
 -  1 x M3x10mm and nut
 - 2 x M5x10mm (upper cam)
 - 2 x M5 t-nut
 - 1 x M5x10mm (lower cam)

 - 2 x M3x20mm and nut
 - 1 x M5x10mm 
 - 2 x M5x10mm and nut


####  Gripper:

The gripper consists of 3 parts.

 - Claw left
 - Claw right
 - Servomount

Claws

![Greifer](https://gitlab.com/solidus/hefei/uploads/cb877748f87ae5cf54f5c071b23b8c46/Greifer.JPG)


To put the gripper together you need the following screws and nuts:

 - 2 x M5x16
 - 8 x M3x16 and nut
 - 2 x M5 t-nut
 - 4 x self cutting Servoscrews


The claws are mounted directly to the servowheel with the selfcutting screws (screws from bottom to top).    


  
####  Servobrick enclosure:

For the servobrick we created just an enclosure with one mounting screw.


To put the enclosure together you need the following screws and nuts:

 - 2x M3x15mm and Nut
 - 1x M4x10mm and Nut
 

The enclosure is mounted on the plate of the Robotino.  

  
####  Mount for Motedisprofile:

Mount

![Motedisprofilholder](https://gitlab.com/solidus/hefei/uploads/0e3ffb524fd94cf9e4883fc5f7e70224/Motedisprofilholder.JPG)

This part was created to mount a 40x20 Motedis profile on the plate of Robotino.

To mount **1** Profile you need the following parts:

1x 3d printed mount
2x M5 x 10mm 
2x M4 x 16mm and nuts
2x M5 t-nut
